# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`

**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

<!--
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.

  The /speckit.tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
  - Feature requirements from plan.md
  - Entities from data-model.md
  - Endpoints from contracts/

  Tasks MUST be organized by user story so each story can be:
  - Implemented independently
  - Tested independently
  - Delivered as an MVP increment

  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.
  ============================================================================

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

Examples of foundational tasks (adjust based on your project):

- [ ] T004 Setup database schema and migrations framework
- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication/authorization framework
- [ ] T006 [P] Setup API routing and middleware structure
- [ ] T007 Create base models/entities that all stories depend on
- [ ] T008 Configure error handling and logging infrastructure
- [ ] T009 Setup environment configuration management

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - [Title] (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 1 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

> **NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py
- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py
- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py (depends on T012, T013)
- [ ] T015 [US1] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
- [ ] T016 [US1] Add validation and error handling
- [ ] T017 [US1] Add logging for user story 1 operations

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - [Title] (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 2 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

- [ ] T018 [P] [US2] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T019 [P] [US2] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T020 [P] [US2] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
- [ ] T021 [US2] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
- [ ] T022 [US2] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
- [ ] T023 [US2] Integrate with User Story 1 components (if needed)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - [Title] (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 3 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

- [ ] T024 [P] [US3] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T025 [P] [US3] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T026 [P] [US3] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
- [ ] T027 [US3] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
- [ ] T028 [US3] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories.

**Constitution-driven categories** (see `.specify/memory/constitution.md`). Every
feature MUST include at least the tasks required to satisfy the release gates
(Principle VI). Delete categories that genuinely do not apply and record the reason
in the plan's Complexity Tracking table.

### Accessibility (Principle I)

- [ ] TXXX Verify semantic HTML, heading order, and landmark structure
- [ ] TXXX [P] Keyboard-only walkthrough of new/changed flows
- [ ] TXXX [P] Run axe-core / Pa11y; resolve all serious/critical issues
- [ ] TXXX Confirm color contrast, focus visibility, and 200% zoom behavior

### Bundle / Performance Budget (Principle II)

- [ ] TXXX Measure per-page JS (gz) \u2264 50 KB and CSS (gz) \u2264 30 KB
- [ ] TXXX [P] Convert new images to AVIF/WebP with fallbacks, add `width`/`height`, lazy-load below-fold
- [ ] TXXX Product images optimized to \u2264 200 KB at 600\u00d7600 (documented in HTML author comment)
- [ ] TXXX Verify LCP < 2.0 s, CLS < 0.1, INP < 200 ms on Lighthouse mobile (4G Fast)

### Security-by-Default (Principle IV)

- [ ] TXXX Verify CSP in `index.html` still contains `default-src 'self'`,
      `script-src 'self'` (no `'unsafe-inline'`, no `'unsafe-eval'`), `frame-ancestors 'none'`,
      `object-src 'none'`, `form-action 'self'`, `base-uri 'self'`, and
      `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- [ ] TXXX [P] Confirm zero inline `<script>` bodies, zero inline styles, zero inline
      event handlers (`onclick=`, etc.) in `index.html`
- [ ] TXXX [P] Every third-party executable resource (e.g. Font Awesome from
      cdnjs.cloudflare.com) carries an `integrity=` hash, `crossorigin="anonymous"`,
      and `referrerpolicy="no-referrer"`
- [ ] TXXX XSS-safe DOM audit: no `innerHTML` / `outerHTML` / `document.write` /
      `insertAdjacentHTML` for user-controlled or storage-hydrated strings; use
      `textContent` and `createElement`
- [ ] TXXX Prototype-pollution / schema-validation audit: every value read from
      `localStorage`, URL params, or network passes a strict validator that
      whitelists keys, type-checks fields, and caps string lengths (reference:
      `isValidCartItem`, `isValidCustomer`)
- [ ] TXXX Confirm input regex + length caps: phone `/^[6-9]\d{9}$/`,
      pincode `/^[1-9]\d{5}$/`, `MAX_QTY_PER_ITEM=99`, `MAX_CART_ITEMS=50`,
      `MAX_MSG_LEN=3800`
- [ ] TXXX [P] `Math.random` scan of production JS returns zero occurrences
      (use `crypto.getRandomValues()` instead)
- [ ] TXXX [P] Every `target="_blank"` link has `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
- [ ] TXXX Any privacy-sensitive API (geolocation, camera, mic, notifications,
      clipboard) is button-triggered, never auto-requested on page load

### Client-Only Architecture / WhatsApp Handoff (Principle V)

- [ ] TXXX Confirm no backend calls, no analytics/tracking pixels, no cookies,
      no service worker registered
- [ ] TXXX [P] `localStorage` schema: keys use the versioned form
      `krishidakshina.<name>.v<N>` (current: `krishidakshina.cart.v1`, `krishidakshina.customer.v1`);
      if the schema changed, bump the version segment and ship a migration or
      fresh-start path
- [ ] TXXX Hydrated localStorage values pass the strict validators from
      Security-by-Default (Principle IV)
- [ ] TXXX Order handoff builds a `wa.me/919876543210` URL (or the centralized
      `WHATSAPP_NUMBER`) with the formatted message length bounded by
      `MAX_MSG_LEN=3800`
- [ ] TXXX [P] Any new `fetch()` targets an origin on the runtime allow-list
      (`api.postalpincode.in`, ...) and is listed in `connect-src` in the CSP
- [ ] TXXX Contact form remains a client-side simulation OR is converted to a
      WhatsApp handoff; introducing a real backend requires a MAJOR constitution
      amendment

### Release Verification (Principle VI)

- [ ] TXXX Produce preview build / preview URL
- [ ] TXXX Lighthouse mobile audit \u2265 90 across Performance, Accessibility,
      Best Practices, SEO
- [ ] TXXX CSP hygiene gate: served CSP contains no `'unsafe-inline'` or
      `'unsafe-eval'` in `script-src`/`style-src`
- [ ] TXXX `Math.random` gate: static scan of production JS finds zero matches
- [ ] TXXX Attach Lighthouse summary and impacted-principles list to the PR
      description

### General polish

- [ ] TXXX [P] Documentation / README updates
- [ ] TXXX Code cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] TXXX Run quickstart.md validation (once quickstart exists)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):
Task: "Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py"
Task: "Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py"
Task: "Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
